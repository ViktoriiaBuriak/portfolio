# 🌸 Personal Portfolio

Personal portfolio website showcasing my frontend projects, skills, and contact information.

## ✨ About the project

This portfolio was built as a **small, focused project** to demonstrate my ability to quickly adapt to **new and unfamiliar technologies**.

I chose **Astro** intentionally — it was **not a framework I had worked with before**.  
The goal was to simulate a real-world situation where a developer needs to:

- learn a new tool fast  
- understand its architecture
- deliver a complete, working result in a short time

The project was built **within a few hours**, using **AI as a support tool** for:
- understanding Astro concepts
- structuring components
- speeding up repetitive tasks

All decisions, adjustments, and final code were reviewed, adapted, and integrated by me.
